The calculator has linear equations in three variables algorithm written which somehow isn't working. Rest everything is good.
it takes value in the for of a numbers string, splits the string and stores the value in a 2D array. But it's showing NaN when done so. And also, the 2 and 3 buttons become non
functional whenn 3 VAR used, i've been trying to set is3Variables= false, but got confused between where exactly to put it for the maintaining the correct flow.
